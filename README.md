# tomato_disease-_predition
This repository demonstrates how to build an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to classify images of tomato plants into different categories based on their disease state. I use CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
