# Tomato Disease Prediction

This repository demonstrates how to build an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to classify images of tomato plants into different categories based on their disease state. The dataset contains images of tomato plants in various conditions, including healthy plants and plants with diseases like Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, and more. To improve the model's performance, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and data augmentation techniques.
